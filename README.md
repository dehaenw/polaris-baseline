# polaris-baseline
Notebooks with the code I used for my entries in the Polaris x ASAP antiviral challenge. In all cases the methods are quite simple and should be treated as baseline methods. The pose prediction task's method is particularly interesting as it is ligand based and still performs quite well compared to other methods.

These are strictly the jupyter notebooks, with the exact notebooks used for submissions. This is not intended for usage outside of illustrating what exactly I submitted. Note that the intermediate submission to the ADMET and Potency challenge had bad predictive performance. In the spirit of full disclosure, I've also included those notebooks. 

For a write-up of my approaches, check the [blog post on my site](https://molecular.beauty/blog/2025/03/14/polaris.html) here. The leaderboard of the challenge is [here](https://antiviral.polarishub.io/). The rankings of my submissions were x/x, y/y and z/z, for the pose prediction, potency and ADMET prediction tasks respectively. For the intermediate leaderboard, the positions were 4/17 and 22/23 and 30/34.
